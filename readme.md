# Express & Handlebars Template
> This is an example node application that uses Express and Handlebars.

## app.js
> Main file.

The [`app.js`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/app.js) is the main file of this project. This file starts the application and has a connection to other server files like `render.js`. Tis file mainly consists *Express* setups and the *URL routes*. Use node on this file to start up the application.

## Package
> Which packages and scripts get used in this project. 

The [`package.json`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/package.json) file holds all used packages, scripts,  and other important information for this project. 

### NPM packages
#### dependencies:
* express
* express-handlebars
* gulp
* gulp-concat
* node

#### devDependencies
* chokidar-cli
* concurrently
* gulp-autoprefixer
* gulp-clean-css
* gulp-minify
* nodemon

### Scripts
#### start
> npm start

The start script, so it starts the application when deploying. The start script uses node on the [`app.js`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/app.js) file.

#### dev
> npm run dev

Development script. Does the same as the start script, but using nodemon to start the application. This package restarts your application when making a change to a document.

#### watch
> npm run watch

This script is used to activate multiple other scripts that watch changes to client-side code, like CSS and client side JS. When activating this script the following happens:

> npm run watch:css =====> npm run build:css  

> npm run watch:js ====> npm run build:js    

The two left scripts above use the chikidar package. Chokidar watches all CSS or JS files, and when something is changed it will run the build script (right command) to compile everything and build the application with updated client-side code.

## Server folder
> Folder that contains server-side code, to split up app.js.

The folder [`server`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/tree/main/server) contains all extra files that run server-side, in this case only including [`render.js`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/server/render.js). This folder coud be seen as an extention to the [`app.js`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/app.js) file, and can contain multiple files which helps maintaining overview in your server-side code.

### render.js
> File that renders all the different pages.

This file is used to render all the webpages. Functions in this document are exported and used in the [`app.js`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/app.js) file, to maintain a good overview.

## Views folder
> All handlebars files.

This folder contains all the handlebars files, which are used to render the HTML to the browser. As a page gets requested from the user the correct page is loaded to the client, requests are handled server-side and rendered through `[render.js](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/server/render.js)` via express.

## Public folder
> Images, CSS and other client side files.

The [`public folder`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/tree/main/public) contains all client-side files. The folder has compiled CSS, compiled JS, a service worker for improved performance and a manifest file to make this a web application. The JavaScript and CSS files are generated by gulp scripts, and the source for the CSS and JS fies is the [`src folder`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/tree/main/src).

## SRC folder
> Contains all client-side CSS and JS files.

This folder contains the origional CSS and JS files. In this map you can make multiple files, to maintain a good overview. The files are compiled and compressed with gulp and npm scripts.

## Scripts folder
> To build, compile, clean and concat client side CSS and JS.

In the [`scripts`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/tree/main/scripts) folder there are two files, [`build-css.js`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/scripts/build-css.js) and [`build-js.js`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/scripts/build-js.js). These files get run whenever a change is made to client-side CSS or JS. The scripts then gather all specified files and compiles it to a new file, which gets pushed into the [`public`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/tree/main/public) folder. The scripts only trigger when running the `npm run watch` command.

## Service worker
> Improved performance through cached files.

The template also has a service worker installed. This service worker is installed to the web application and will cache pages and files. This improves performance and reduces requests to the server. The service worker is initialised through the `[sw-init.js](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/src/js/sw-init.js)` file, and is used client-side using the [`sw.js`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/public/sw.js) file, which defines all stored assets.

## Manifest
> Making this template a Progressive Web App.

The public folder also contains a [`manifest.json`](https://github.com/RickGroot/Express-Handlebars-Template/blob/main/public/manifest.json) file. This defines all information to become a progressive web app. Through this file the application could be installed onto your own device.
